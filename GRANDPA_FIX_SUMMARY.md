# GRANDPA Halting Fix Summary

## Problem Description

When adding external validators to the Fennel blockchain through the `validator-manager` pallet, GRANDPA consensus halted while Aura continued producing blocks. This resulted in blocks being produced but not finalized.

## Root Cause

The `validator-manager` pallet was allowing validators to be added to the active set without verifying that their session keys (Aura + GRANDPA) were registered. When GRANDPA tried to communicate with validators that had no GRANDPA keys, consensus failed and finalization stopped.

## The Actual Workflow

Based on the FennelValidator repository analysis, the correct workflow is:

1. **Validator sets up their node** and connects to the network
2. **Validator generates session keys** using `author_rotateKeys` RPC
3. **Validator sends keys and account info** to the sudo/admin
4. **Sudo funds the validator's stash account**
5. **Sudo registers session keys** on behalf of the validator using `session.setKeys()`
6. **Sudo adds the validator** using `validatorManager.registerValidators()`

## Solution Implemented

### Simple Fix: Key Verification

Modified the `validator-manager` pallet to check that session keys are registered before adding validators:

```rust
// In register_validators function
for validator in validators.clone() {
    // Check if validator has session keys registered
    let keys = <pallet_session::NextKeys<T>>::get(&validator);
    ensure!(
        keys.is_some(),
        Error::<T>::NoKeysRegistered
    );
    
    // Add to the queue
    current_validators_to_add.push(validator);
}
```

### Changes Made

1. **Added new error type**: `NoKeysRegistered` to indicate missing session keys
2. **Added validation check**: Before adding each validator, verify `Session::NextKeys` exists
3. **Updated weights**: Added read operation for `Session::NextKeys` storage

## Benefits

1. **Prevents GRANDPA halting**: Validators without keys cannot be added
2. **Clear error messages**: Admin gets `NoKeysRegistered` error if keys missing
3. **Minimal changes**: Simple check that doesn't alter the existing workflow
4. **Backward compatible**: Existing validators and processes continue working

## Testing the Fix

1. **Attempt to add validator without keys**:
   ```javascript
   // This should fail with NoKeysRegistered
   api.tx.validatorManager.registerValidators([validatorWithoutKeys])
   ```

2. **Correct process**:
   ```javascript
   // First register keys
   await api.tx.sudo.sudoAs(
     validator,
     api.tx.session.setKeys(keys, '0x00')
   ).signAndSend(sudo);
   
   // Then add validator - this should succeed
   await api.tx.validatorManager.registerValidators([validator])
     .signAndSend(sudo);
   ```

## Deployment

1. **Build the updated runtime** with the modified pallet
2. **Test on staging network** first
3. **Perform runtime upgrade** if network is already running
4. **No migration needed** - existing validators already have keys

## Monitoring After Deployment

- Verify GRANDPA continues finalizing blocks
- Check that new validators can be added following the correct process
- Monitor for any `NoKeysRegistered` errors in failed transactions
- Ensure validator count remains stable

## Key Takeaway

The fix ensures that the validator-manager pallet enforces the requirement that all validators must have session keys registered before they can participate in consensus. This prevents the scenario where GRANDPA tries to communicate with validators that have no cryptographic identity, which was causing consensus to halt.
