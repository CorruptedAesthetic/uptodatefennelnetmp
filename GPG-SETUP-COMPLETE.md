# GPG Release Signing Setup Complete

## ✅ What's Been Configured

### 1. GPG Key Setup
- **Key ID**: `40450D6C3BFCD633`
- **Owner**: CorruptedAesthetic (FennelLabs)
- **Status**: ✅ Active and configured
- **Public Key**: Exported to `.github/release-signing.pub.asc`

### 2. GitHub Actions Integration
- **Signature Verification**: ✅ Enabled in workflow
- **Tag Format Validation**: ✅ `fennel-node-X.Y.Z` pattern required
- **Automatic Import**: ✅ Public key imported during CI
- **Fail-Safe**: ✅ Build fails if signature verification fails

### 3. Release Tools
- **Script**: `create-release-tag.sh` - Helper for creating signed tags
- **Verification**: Automatic tag signature verification
- **Documentation**: Enhanced CI/CD guide updated

## 🚀 How to Create a Signed Release

### Option 1: Using the Helper Script (Recommended)
```bash
./create-release-tag.sh 0.4.3 "Enhanced CI/CD with security features"
git push origin fennel-node-0.4.3
```

### Option 2: Manual Commands
```bash
# Create signed tag
git tag -s fennel-node-0.4.3 -m "Fennel node v0.4.3"

# Verify signature locally
git verify-tag fennel-node-0.4.3

# Push to trigger CI
git push origin fennel-node-0.4.3
```

## 🔒 Security Flow

1. **You create** a signed tag with your GPG key
2. **GitHub Actions** imports your public key and verifies the signature
3. **If verification passes**, the secure build pipeline runs:
   - Docker image built and tagged with release version
   - Image digest captured for immutable verification
   - Chainspecs generated with SHA-256 hashes
   - Helm chart updated with all security metadata
   - GitHub release created with all artifacts
4. **If verification fails**, the build stops immediately

## 🛡️ What This Prevents

- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Only you can create valid releases
- **Image Substitution**: Digest-based references prevent tampering
- **Chainspec Tampering**: SHA-256 verification ensures integrity
- **Unauthorized Releases**: Unsigned tags are rejected

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Commit these changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: implement GPG-signed release pipeline with enhanced security"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Test with a release tag**:
   ```bash
   ./create-release-tag.sh 0.4.3 "Test release with enhanced security"
   git push origin fennel-node-0.4.3
   ```

3. **Watch the GitHub Actions workflow** to ensure everything works

Your fennel-solonet repository now has enterprise-grade release security! 🎉
