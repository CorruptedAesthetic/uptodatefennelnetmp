# Fennel Node Release Signing Public Key
# 
# This file should contain the GPG public key used to sign release tags.
# 
# To set up tag signing:
# 1. Generate a GPG key: gpg --full-gen-key
# 2. Export the public key: gpg --armor --export YOUR_KEY_ID > .github/release-signing.pub.asc
# 3. Upload the public key to GitHub (Settings â†’ SSH and GPG keys)
# 4. Update the workflow to import this key and verify tags
# 
# For now, tag verification is implemented with basic format validation.
# TODO: Replace with actual GPG public key for production releases.
